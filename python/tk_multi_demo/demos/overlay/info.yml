description:
    The progress overlay module provides a standardized progress overlay widget
    which can easily be placed on top of any other PySide.QtGui.QWidget to
    indicate that work is happening and potentially report messages back to the
    user. Once you have instantiated and placed it on top of another widget,
    you can execute various methods to control its state.
